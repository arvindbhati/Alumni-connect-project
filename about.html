This helps in developing creativeness in student and better learning of the subject. STUDENT-READY program is the most relevant example of this which is very well adopted in the CTAE.</div><br>
    <div>Online Courses and Learning: This trend is being most encouraged in MPUAT and students are accessing to various online courses, trainings, internships etc. All most all the times the course fee is borne by the university. This provides them an opportunity to get better understanding on tough subjects by doing additional courses on the same subjects. It also helps them to focus more on their preferred area and do in-depth research on those subjects.</div><br>
